3. Apply the guidance directly to the current task, keeping changes minimal and repository-consistent.
4. Validate results (tests/lint/build where relevant).
5. Summarize what was applied from this skill and where.

## Input Guidance

When invoking this skill manually, include:

- Task goal
- Target files or modules
- Any constraints (performance, architecture, style, tests)

## Source
